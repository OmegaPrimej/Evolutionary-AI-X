Cosmic Space Neuron Networks
The Cosmic Space Neuron Networks (CSNN) are a theoretical framework for understanding the interconnectedness of the universe. The CSNN model proposes that the universe is comprised of infinitesimally small, interconnected nodes that process and transmit information.


# cosmic_space_neuron_networks.py
import numpy as np

class CosmicSpaceNeuronNetworks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = []
        self.connections = []

    def add_node(self, node):
        self.nodes.append(node)

    def add_connection(self, node1, node2):
        self.connections.append((node1, node2))

    def process_information(self):
        # Process information through the network
        pass
```

Nexus Prime Nodes
The Nexus Prime Nodes (NPN) are a hypothetical network of interconnected nodes that facilitate communication and information exchange between different points in space-time.

```
nexus_prime_nodes.py
import numpy as np

class NexusPrimeNodes:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = []
        self.connections = []

    def add_node(self, node):
        self.nodes.append(node)

    def add_connection(self, node1, node2):
        self.connections.append((node1, node2))

    def communicate(self, node1, node2):
        # Communicate between nodes
