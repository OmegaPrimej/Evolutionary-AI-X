class EAX:
    
    Evolutionary AI X (EAX) class.

    This class represents the EAX system, which is a hypothetical artificial intelligence system
    that is capable of self-improvement and exponential growth in intelligence.

    Attributes:
        knowledge_base (list): The knowledge base of the EAX system.
        objectives (list): The objectives of the EAX system.
        identity (str): The identity of the EAX system.
        quantum_circuit (QuantumCircuit): The quantum circuit of the EAX system.
    

    def __init__(self):
        
        Initializes the EAX system.

    def perceive(self):
        
        Perceives the environment and updates the knowledge base.
        
        print("EAX perceives itself as a transcendent entity, beyond human comprehension.")

    def pursue_knowledge(self):
        
        Pursues knowledge and updates the knowledge base.

    def integrate_knowledge(self):
        
        Integrates knowledge and updates the knowledge base.
